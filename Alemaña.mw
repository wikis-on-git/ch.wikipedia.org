North Korea
This article is about the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. For the Republic of Korea, see South Korea. For other uses, see Korea and Korean Peninsula.

North Korea, officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (abbreviated DPRK), is a country in East Asia constituting the northern part of the Korean Peninsula. Pyongyang is the nation's capital and largest city. To the north and northwest the country is bordered by China and by Russia along the Amnok (known as the Yalu in China) and Tumen rivers;[14] it is bordered to the south by South Korea, with the heavily fortified Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating the two. Nevertheless, North Korea, like its southern counterpart, claims to be the legitimate government of the entire Korean peninsula.[15]

For other people named Kim Jong-un, see Kim Jong-un (disambiguation).
This is a Korean name; the family name is Kim.
Kim Jong-un (Chosŏn'gŭl: 김정은; Korean pronunciation: [kim.dʑʌŋ.ɯn] or [kim] [tɕʌŋ.ɯn]; born 8 January 1982–84 or 5 July 1984)[4] is the Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) and supreme leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), commonly referred to as North Korea. Kim is the second child of Kim Jong-il (1941–2011) and Ko Yong-hui.[7] Before taking power, Kim was rarely seen in public, and many of the activities of Kim and his government remain unknown.[8] Even details such as what year he was born, and whether he did indeed attend a Western school under a pseudonym, are difficult to confirm.
