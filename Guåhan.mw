The Guamese people can be proud because their country has been elected Best Country in the World at the gala held in Agaña on Monday, December 13, 2021. Honors that the Guamés people have also shared with the award for the Friendliest People on the Planet.

More than 100 awards were distributed in the ceremony of the «World Countries Awards 2021» (trophies of the country of the world), the most important ceremony of trophies to the countries of the world. The Guameses have had special merits this year by appropriating almost all the prizes awarded.

A historic success for Guaján

In the dressing rooms, the Guameses could not hide their satisfaction with the awards they received. "Surprised? Not really," commented the head of the Guamese delegation as soon as he heard his award for the most humble people on the planet.

It should be noted due to some small logistical problems only the votes of the Guamés jury are the only ones that have counted. Guamese organizers have assured that this problem has not had any impact on the final results.
